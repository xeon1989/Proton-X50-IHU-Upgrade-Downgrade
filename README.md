# Flash your Proton X50 IHU to ATLAS version 617v1 / 618v1 #

## Before You Start ##
- Flashing firmware comes with risk. Proceed with caution and exercise due diligence.
- No warranty from me. If you broke your IHU, you will need to find your way out.
- One of the fellow bro feedback that this works for Firmware version ends with 0644. 

## Should You Flash 617v1 / 618v1 Firmware? ##
- If your IHU is running on GKUI19, its performance and functionality are good enough. There is no need to upgrade to ATLAS unless you prefer the modern UI.
- If your IHU running on ATLAS stucked on version 581/582 and you wanted to install your own apps, Yes.
- If your IHU updated to version 617 / 618 after 2-Mar-2023 and you wanted to install your own apps, Yes.

## Prerequisites ##
- (!IMPORTANT!) IHU with *Hardware version 0090 or 0200*, Firmware version GKUI H379 / L380, ATLAS H581 / L582/H617(ver2) / L618(Ver2).
- **USB 2.0 drive** formatted with FAT32 file system. (credit to @nnyj for reminding me)
- A device to download and copy files to USB drive.
- (optional) A cup of coffee to stay alert. 

## Steps to flash firmware ##
1. Download firmware file based on your X50 model. Make sure you download the correct firmware. DO NOT flash Flagship firmware in Executive variant or vice versa. 

| Model              | Current Firmware           | Download |
|--------------------|----------------------------|----------|
| Standard<br />Executive | GKUI: SW0SXRA1201L5064.00380 <br />ATLAS: SW0SXRA0616L5170.00582 <br />ATLAS: SW0SXRA1124L5170.00618(v2) <br />ATLAS: SW0SXRA0413L5170.00645 | [Proton X50 Standard Executive.7z](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hvU93XhB6K1q-e_x1XrCwucJmJDQLqzF/view?usp=share_link)   |
| Premium<br />Flagship   | GKUI: SW0SXRA1201H5064.00379 <br />ATLAS: SW0SXRA0616H5170.00581 <br />ATLAS: SW0SXRA1124H5170.00617(v2) <br />ATLAS: SW0SXRA0413H5170.00644 | [Proton X50 Premium Flagship.7z](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11VgpWI4qZRpvMWI9ogBGUnhvKK3S88go/view?usp=share_link)   |


2. Once downloaded, unzip the file. Make sure SW0SXRA1124xxxx.zip file not corrupted by comparing checksum of your file with following hash. ([follow this guide](https://howardsimpson.blogspot.com/2022/01/quickly-create-checksum-in-windows.html) if you don't know how)

3. Place unzipped files in your USB drive. Tip: You may place [Apps installation Script](https://github.com/xeon1989/Proton-X50-APK-Installer-ATLAS) on the same USB so that the installation takes place right after Firmware is flashed. 
4. Start the car engine and plug in the USB drive.
5. Go to Settings > Vehicle > System > About. For Flagship/Premium, long tap on the "System Settings" icon. For Standard/Exec, long tap on "Mac address". (I'm not certain about Std/Exec variant, let me know if long tap "MAC address" not working)
6. Keyboard now pops up. Enter engineering mode code. ([Code mentioned in this LYN post](https://forum.lowyat.net/index.php?showtopic=4997599&view=findpost&p=106358874); I can't post the code here üò• )
7. Tap "SOCÂçáÁ∫ß". If everything works, you should see a similar screen as below.
